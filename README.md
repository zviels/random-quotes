# Random Quotes

A front end project I built for my portfolio during my studies at [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com). The app displays random quotes each time a button is clicked. Quotes also automatically refresh every fifteen seconds.

## Overview

- The topics I learned before I started developing the app.
- The requirements I had to meet to complete this project.
- Additional features I chose to implement for the app.
- The rating the project received.

### What Did I Learn?

### Project Requirements

You can view the project requirements [here](https://deab9i1yeabp0.cloudfront.net/github/treehouse/random-quotes/project-requirements.jpg).

### Additional Features

Here I will list additional features that I implemented for the app, even though I didn't have to. These features may extend the functionality of the app, improve the user experience or beautify the user interface.

As of this moment I have implemented one additional feature for the app.

When I tested the project, I noticed that it is quite common to get the same quote twice in a row. I fixed that. In the current situation, the quotes will start repeating themselves only after each quote has already been displayed on the page once.

### Rating

There are two possible grades for each Techdegree project - "Meets Expectations" and "Exceeds Expectations".

This project received the **"Exceeds Expectations"** rating.
