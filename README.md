# Random Quotes

A front end project I built for my portfolio during my studies at [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com). The app displays random quotes each time a button is clicked. Quotes also automatically refresh every fifteen seconds.

## Quick Start

To view the app -

- You can [download the ZIP file](https://github.com/zviels/random-quotes/archive/refs/heads/master.zip), extract it and open `index.html`.
- Alternatively, you can watch the app online [here](https://zviels.github.io/random-quotes).

## Overview

As mentioned above, I developed this app as part of my studies at [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com). I participated in their [Techdegree](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree) program. In this section you can read about -

- The topics I learned before I started developing the app.
- The requirements I had to meet to complete this project.
- Additional features I chose to implement for the app.
- The rating the project received.

### What Did I Learn?

Here is what I learned before I started working on the project -

- Introduction to HTML and CSS <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-HTML%20Course-3659a2" alt="HTML Course"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-CSS%20Course-3659a2" alt="CSS Course">

- JavaScript Objects <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-JS%20Course-3659a2" alt="JS Course">

I also learned how to use Slack, VS Code and GitHub Desktop.

### Project Requirements

#### Array of Objects

I had to create an array of objects. This array - 

- Had to be named `quotes`.
- Had to include at least five quote objects.
- Had to be free of errors that prevent the code from running.

#### Object Properties

- All objects had to include `quote` and `source` properties.
- At least one object had to include `citation` property.
- At least one object had to include `year` property.

To exceed expectations, I had to -

- Create at least one additional property (such as `tags`), for at least one object.
- Print at least one additional property to the page with its quote.

#### Functions

I had to implement two functions.

##### The 'getRandomQuote' Function

This function -

- Had to be named `getRandomQuote`.
- Had to return a random object from the `quotes` array.

##### The 'printQuote' Function

This function -

- Had to be named `printQuote`.
- Had to call the `getRandomQuote` function.
- Had to print a `quote` and a `source` property with every object.
- Had to print a `citation` property with at least one quote.
- Had to print a `year` property with at least one quote.

In addition, the printed quotes had to match the format, layout and styles of the example quote in the `index.html` file -

```
    <p class="quote"> A Random Quote </p>
    <p class="source"> Quote Source
        <span class="citation"> Quote Citation </span>
        <span class="year"> Quote Year </span>
    </p>
```

To exceed expectations, I had to -

- Change the quotes automatically at regular intervals.
- Change the background color to a random color each time the quote refreshes.

#### Code Comments

To meet the requirements of the project I also had to provide code comments.

### Additional Features

Here I will list additional features that I implemented for the app, even though I didn't have to. These features may extend the functionality of the app, improve the user experience or beautify the user interface.

As of this moment I have implemented one additional feature for the app.

When I tested the project, I noticed that it is quite common to get the same quote twice in a row. I fixed that. In the current situation, the quotes will start repeating themselves only after each quote has already been displayed on the page once.

### Rating

There are two possible grades for each Techdegree project - "Meets Expectations" and "Exceeds Expectations".

This project received the **"Exceeds Expectations"** rating.
